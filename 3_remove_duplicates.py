Remove Duplicate in a List

Remove Duplicates from a List

You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program that removes any duplicate elements from the list and returns a new list with only unique elements. The order of elements in the list should be maintained.

Parameters:

    lst (List of integers): The list of integers from which duplicates should be removed.

Returns:

    A list of integers where all duplicates have been removed, preserving the original order.

Example:

    Input: lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
    Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    Input: lst = [4, 5, 5, 4, 6, 7]
    Output: [4, 5, 6, 7]
