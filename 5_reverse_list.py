Program to Reverse a List

Reverse a List (Non-Slicing Approach)

You are given a list of integers. Write a Python program that reverses the list without using slicing (lst[::-1]). The program should return the reversed list.

Parameters:

    lst (List of integers): The list of integers to be reversed.

Returns:

    A list of integers where the order of elements is reversed from the input list.

Example:

    Input: lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
"""

def reverse_list(lst):
    # Your code goes here
    return lst[::-1]
